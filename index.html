      <P>I've been trying to be a little bit different since I was child, when I was   growing up I had to adjust with the
        rules of the world. I didn't success , but I didn't give up either. I thought I had studied the other side, but
        what happened ? So I moved towards the computer and now I want to move forward in life with Programming at
        Computer -Science. I need a platform to show my skills and prove that Iâ€™m the best. Anyway, I talked a lot,
        thank you.</P>
